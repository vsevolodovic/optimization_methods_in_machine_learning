This project is the second assignment of the Istanbul Technical University machine learning master's course numbered BLG527E. 
Gradient Descent and Newton's method was created to minimmize the loss function of model. 
My homework grade is 95. So there may be some mistakes. You can find detailed information about the project in the source file. 
For background information, i suggest you to watch Dr. İslem Rekik's Machine Learning lecture videos. Link is given below.
Thanks to Dr. İslem Rekik and her assistant Dogay Kamar for their contributions.
